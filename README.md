# Classification of REM Sleep Behaviour Disorder from Sleep Electromyograms using Wavelet Scattering Based Machine Learning
The following project aims to implement a machine learning algorithm that can detect the presence of Rapid Eye Movement (REM) Sleep Behaviour Disorder (RBD) by analyzing features from electromyography (EMG) signals.

# Overview 
This project is comprised of three interconnected sections, preprocessing, feature extraction, and machine learning. The overall algorithm is based on EMG signals from a collection of polysomnography (PSG) that were acquired from a public online database. Upon processing and analyzing signal epochs, a machine-learning algorithm was created to determine whether a subject has healthy or disordered sleep.

# Data Source
The Cyclic Alternating Pattern (CAP) database from PhsyioNet was used. From this database, EMG data was analyzed by first preprocessing the data, followed by the extraction of features.
